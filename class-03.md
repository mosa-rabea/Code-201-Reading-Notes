# Lists
* ### HTML have three different types of lists:

* Ordered lists :are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
* Unordered lists : are lists that begin with a bullet point .<ul

* Definition lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes in css

The box will break onto a new line.
The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
* The width and height properties are respected.
Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
# Control flow
* The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

* Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

* For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

' if (field==empty) { promptUser(); } else { submitForm(); } '
